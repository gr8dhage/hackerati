This is a website that simulates monitoring of a real time temperature sensor and displays the recorded data.
By clicking on the "Start generating data" button new sensor data is collected from a hypothetical reactor.
The recorded temperature can be seen below the button. You can refresh the web page to view the graph and table 
for the new data values. The graph is generated using HighCharts and jQuery is also used as required.
